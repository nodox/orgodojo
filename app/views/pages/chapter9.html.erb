			        • Nucleophilic subtitutions are powerful reactions that can help manipulate functional groups. These manipulations are essential when you can to synthesize products with a particular functional propery.

							•	We encountered two nucleophilic substitution (S<sub>N</sub>) reactions with alcohols. Halogens were used as a nucleophiles but they were only the tip of the iceberg.<br>
							•	Picture of all the SN reactions possible
							•	Here you can see that there are a variety of species that act as nucleophiles. Good nucleophiles always have an excess of electrons, which is why they have a negative charge. Anionic nucleophiles donate electrons.<br>
							•	Picture of iodide replacing bromine
							•	These reactions can also be used to manipulate functional groups. Iodide replaces the Bromine as a leaving group. The introduction of the Iodide leaving group makes the molecule more reactive because Iodide is a better leaving group than bromine.<br>

•	The biggest difference between S<sub>N</sub>1 and S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions are found at each reaction's rate-determining step.
•	Picture of SN2 mechanism (use SN2 mechanism subtitle for identification)
•	The S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism is one step and bimolecular (involves two species), often called a concerted step.  The nucleophile attacks the electrophilic carbon from behind and displaces the leaving group. This mechanisms follows this rate law: rate = k[Nuc][R-LG]. 
•	Steric hindrance also plays a huge role in reaction rates. Lower degrees of substitution contribute to faster reaction rates because many bulky substituents causes atomic crowding. Remember that reactivity order depends on degrees of substitution: methyl > 1° > 2° > 3°.
•	Picture of S<sub>N</sub>1 mechanism (use S<sub>N</sub>1 mechanism title)
•	The S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction is a two-step process but is unimolecular (one species is involved).The leaving group is lost, a carbocation is generated, and then a nucleophile attacks the electrophilic carbocation. Remember that carbocation stability increases by degree of substitution: 3°> 2° > 1° > Methyl. The rate law is represented as rate = k[R-LG].

•	The type of solvents used can speed up or decrease the rate of a reaction.
•	Picture of Polar Aprotic Solvents (need caption)
•	Polar aprotic solvents do not promote hydrogen bonding because the do not have a hydrogen that can contribute to hydrogen bonding. Aprotic solvents increase SN2 reaction rates because the lack of protons in the solvent does not hinder the nucleophilic reaction. The nucleophile does not react with the solvent.
•	Picture of Polar protic Solvents (need caption)
•	Polar protic solvents are great for SN1 reactions because they stabilize the displaced leaving group with partial positive charges in the solvent. The solvent also stabilizes the carbocation with partial negative charges. This occurs via solvation: the solvent surrounds each species with their partial charge atoms.
•	Picture of solvation in SN1 reactions maybe???
