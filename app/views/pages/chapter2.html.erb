							<p>• Atoms are the collection of a subatomic particles found in all matter.<br> 
							•	These subatomic particles are called protons, neutrons, and electrons.<br>
							•	Each one has a charge: Protons (+1), neutrons (0), and electrons (-1).<br>
							•	Electrons are located in orbitals: regions in 3D space outside the atomic nucleus.<br>
							•	Orbitals can have different names, shapes and properties. The s and p orbitals will be most relevant.<br>
							•	Orbital, which also includes electrons, are used in chemical bonding.<br>
							•	S orbitals bond or overlap head-on along the internuclear axis.<br>
							•	P orbitals overlap above and below the internuclear axis.

							<p>• There are two major bonds: ionic and covalent.<br>
							•	Ionic bonds involve charged species or ions. These bonds occurs when on elemental species donates electrons to another species to form charged molecules. Ex: NaCl<br>
							•	Covalent bonds occur when two species share electrons pairs.<br> 
							Covalent bonds can be triple, double, or single bonds.<br>
							•	The atom and dot representation of covalent bonds are called Lewis structures.<br>
							•	Covalent bonds are formed so each atom has a complete octet or 8 electrons with some atoms serving as exceptions: Helium, Hydrogen, and Boron.

							<%= image_tag "ch101-diazomethaneare-resonance.png" , size: "425x128", class: "center-img" %>	
							•	Resonance structures are molecules that have more than one correct Lewis structure. The true structure is called a resonance hybrid.<br>
							•	These structures are obtained by moving electrons.
							<%= image_tag "ch102-resonance-arrows.png" , size: "425x128", class: "center-img" %>
							•	A curved arrow is used to indicate the direction of electron motion.<br>
							•	Electrons are moved so that the octet rule can be obeyed in the new Lewis structure.<br>
							•	As you can see above the delocalization (or movement) of electron causes each atom to gain a new relative charge based on the electron distribution called a formal charge.<br>
							•	To determine the formal charge of each atom we use the formula: FC = # of valence electrons - # of assigned valence electron<br>
							•	Where the number of assigned valence electrons are the electrons that are donated by that atom for form a covalent bond.<br>
							•	When a molecule has multiple Lewis structures, the preferred structure will be the one with minimized formal charges or will have the negative charge on the most electronegative atom.<br>
							•	Based on the electron distribution the molecule can have a dipole moment.<br>
							•	Dipole moments is the net direction of the polarity within a molecule.<br>
							•	Dipoles exist in molecules with atoms of different electronegativity values.<br>
							•	Think of vector additions from physics when working out these problems<br>

							•	Notice how in the condensed version converts carbon atoms to vertices and hides the hydrogen atom.<br>
							•	This representation is called the bond line formula.<br>
							•	Vertices represent carbon atoms. If no other atoms are shown then draw hydrogen bonds to each carbon until the octet rule is obeyed. Ex: Terminal single bonded carbons in pentane are bonded to 3 hydrogen atoms.

				<h2 class="section-header section-index-top-header emphasis">Alkanes: Hydrocarbon Molecules</h2>
				<p>• Hydrocarbons are molecules that only contain carbon and hydrogen bonds. Below are some examples.<br>
				<%= image_tag "ch201-alkanes.png", size: "650x128", class: "center-img" %>
				•	Each molecule fits into a functional group category that is listed below the name.<br>
				•	Molecules names are generated based on their functional class.<br>
				</p>

				<h2 class="section-header section-index-top-header emphasis">Alkanes and Isomers</h2>
				<p>• Alkanes can be drawn in straight chains or in branched chains, if long enough.<br>
				• The many different branched alkanes generated are called constitutional isomers.
				<%= image_tag "ch202-isomers.png", size: "350x150", class: "center-img" %>

				•	The molecular formula for each isomer is the same (C4H10) but the connectivity is different.<br>
				•	Alkanes that are missing a hydrogen to be complete have the –yl ending.<br>
				•	Alkyl groups are substituent groups. Below we can see methyl is a substituent of the R compound (R represents any compound).<br>
				<%= image_tag "ch203-methane and methyl.png", size: 256, class: "center-img" %>

				</p>

				<h2 class="section-header section-index-top-header emphasis">Nomenclature</h2>
				<p>• Follow these rules to name these molecules.<br>
				•	Step 1: Identify the longest continuous carbon chain<br>
				•	Step 2: All other carbons will be substituents that end in –yl<br>
				•	Step 3: Number the chain in the direction that gives the slowest substituent position<br>
				•	Step 4: Write the name formula: alkyl pos. + alkyl name + continuous chain name<br>

				<h2 class="section-header section-index-top-header emphasis">Chemical Properties of Alkanes</h2>
				<p>• Alkanes are generally unreactive and often used as solvents for you reactants.<br>
				</p>

				<h2 class="section-header section-index-top-header emphasis">Physical Properties of Alkanes</h2>
				<p>• Alknaes have low melting points.<br>
				• Alkanes also have low boiling points.<br>
				•	Soluble in nonpolar solvents due to weak induced dipole intermolecular forces (the “like dissolves like” concept).<br>
				•	Branched alkanes have lower boiling points than linear alkanes because they have less surface area available for intermolecular force (IMF) interactions. Less stacking results in weaker IMFs holding the molecules together in phase.<br>
				</p>
		

				<h2 class="section-header section-index-top-header emphasis">Stability of Alkanes</h2>
				<p>• Branched alkane isomers are more stable than the linear isomers.<br>
				•	Alkanes are stable molecules.
				</p>

				<h2 class="section-header section-index-top-header emphasis">Heat of Combustion</h2>
				<p>• Branched alkanes expend less energy than linear alkanes when subjected to combustion due to their stability.
